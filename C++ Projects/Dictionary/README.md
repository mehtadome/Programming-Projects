# C++ Dictionary (2016)
Dictionary is composed of several classes, each serving their own function.

The purpose of this project is to create a book (which is stored using an ID) and a book name (description) and store it in a dictionary of books. The dictionary is meant to hold as many IDs and book descriptions as the user wants. 

The user can also call back the ID and see the book description if desired.
