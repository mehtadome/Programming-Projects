# Visualization

Visualization is the art of depicting large sets of data as pictures.

This program uses functions to create interesting colorful images. Hope you enjoy. 

The following .java files: Barnsley, Cantor, ComplexDynamicsFunction, WCF2 are all complex functions that paint a very interesting image.

Run the grader to test my code's accuracy :)
