# Programming-Examples
Small, neat projects I partook in either through class or for fun. 

I have worked with Java, Python, PHP, MySQL, Swift, C, C++ 
  + In many projects, I took the lead and drove the project as head coder and designer
  + This skill has given me the ability to think on my own, self-learn, and adaot where necessary
